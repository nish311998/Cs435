// Nishanth Gona cs435 8111 mp

Java Version:


java -version

java version "10.0.2" 2018-07-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13, mixed mode)





Notes:

There are no bugs seen as long as command prompt is used as shown in the p1435s19 document.

Only bug I have seen is if I am running in AFS I need to comment line which declares which package(eg. "package cs435;") we are using. This line is necessary in the eclipse but not when running in terminal.


When running pagerank_8111.java you will get a statement saying "Note: pagerank_8111.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details." but the program will still work accordingly


Hashing:



Assumptions:



HashFull: I did not print or return any value simply checked if both T and A were full. In addition, I used HashFull with HashInsert when we had "overflow" with T or ran out of space in A and updated it accordingly.



HashEmpty: Simply checks if array A and T are full does not return or print any values. Wanted to implement a way to decrease array T and A back to original size if either were increased and they were both empty but decided against because it was not specified in notes.



Did not return any values for any functions




Error:

If m is declared to be a very small value then there are certain instance where I have a stack overflow error.

If string being inserted is very large over 100 characters sometimes I get a stack overflow error.




PageRank:



Assumptions:


For output assumed decimal values up to 6 decimal places



Also for negative iteration value only allowed between -2 and -6 will not work for others. So, it will produce output for iteration value
of 0, -6 to -2, and greater than zero.
